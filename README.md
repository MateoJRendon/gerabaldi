# Gerabaldi
A temporal simulator for probabilistic degradation and failure processes with a focus on
integrated circuit wear-out reliability.

## Installation
Currently, Gerabaldi is installed by cloning this repository and making it available to your Python code. We are in the
process of getting a PyPi distribution set up and reducing the number of required package dependencies to a minimum.

## Citing this repository
If you use the Gerabaldi simulator to aid in your research it would be greatly appreciated if you could cite the
Gerabaldi 2023 IEEE VLSI Test Symposium paper in any resulting publications.
